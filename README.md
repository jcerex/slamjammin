# SlamJammin

https://slamjammin.herokuapp.com

SlamJammin is a project created to help a friend create music. The idea is based around recording snippets of audio of people raging about issues around which music can be created. It was originally only half completed and I have come back to it to make it deployable. It still needs a lot of work to make it production ready.

If you find any issues please feel free to add a GitHub issue.
